# ECG Signal Denoising and Classification

This project focuses on denoising ECG (Electrocardiogram) signals and subsequently classifying them into different categories. It uses a combination of advanced signal processing techniques and deep learning models to achieve accurate results.

## Project Overview

The main components of this project are:

1. ECG Signal Denoising
2. CNN-LSTM Model for ECG Classification
3. Data Preprocessing and Loading
4. Model Training and Evaluation

## Dependencies

- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- wfdb
- tqdm
- TensorBoard

## Installation

1 . Clone this repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Milan002/ecg-denoising-classification.git
cd ecg-denoising-classification
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2 . Download the ECG data:

Visit the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database: https://www.physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/
Download the database files
Place the downloaded files in a directory named ecg_data in the project root
## Usage

To run the main script:

```bash
python main_torch.py
```

This will load the ECG data, denoise it, train the CNN-LSTM model, and evaluate its performance.

## Project Structure

- `main_torch.py`: The main script that orchestrates the data loading, model creation, training, and evaluation.
- `utils.py`: Contains utility functions for data loading, preprocessing, and visualization.

## ECG Signal Denoising

We use a Hierarchical Kalman Filter (HKF) for denoising the ECG signals. This method is implemented in the `hierarchical_kalman_filter` function in `utils.py`.

## CNN-LSTM Model

The classification model is a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The model architecture is defined in the `CNNLSTMModel` class in `main_torch.py`.

## Data Preprocessing

The ECG data is loaded and preprocessed using functions in `utils.py`. The `get_data_set` function loads ECG records, applies denoising, and extracts relevant segments around R-peaks.

## Training and Evaluation

The model is trained using PyTorch, with the training process managed by the `train_epochs` function. The training progress is logged using TensorBoard, allowing for easy visualization of metrics.

## Results

After training, the models performance is evaluated on a test set. The results are visualized using:

1. Accuracy and loss plots (saved as `accuracy.png` and `loss.png`)
2. A confusion matrix (saved as `confusion_matrix.png`)

## Future Work

- Experiment with different denoising techniques
- Try other deep learning architectures for classification
- Incorporate more ECG leads for potentially improved accuracy
